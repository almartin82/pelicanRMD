```{r pelican_conf, echo=FALSE}

#set this to true when ready to publish
ready_to_publish = TRUE

library(knitr)
hook_plot <- knit_hooks$get('plot')

knit_hooks$set(plot=function(x, options) {
    if (!is.null(options$pelican.publish) && options$pelican.publish) {
        x <- paste0("{filename}", x)
    }
    hook_plot(x, options)
})
opts_chunk$set(dev = 'Cairo_svg')
opts_chunk$set(pelican.publish = ready_to_publish)

# knitr Rmd vs. pelican generation logic here
# for instance, if .Rproj vs pelican content filepaths differ, set a dynamic prefix here
if (ready_to_publish) {

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
